<h2 id="what-is-a-project">What is a project?</h2>
<p>A project is <b><u>a temporary endeavor</u>(effort) which <u>has defined starting and ending</u>, undertaken to <u>create a unique product, service or result.</u></b> A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and ending. And a project is unique in that the product or service is different in some way from all the other products/services.</p>
<h2 id="project-characteristicsattributes">Project characteristics/attributes</h2>
<p>A project:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Has a unique purpose</b> (well defined objective)</li>
<li>Is <b>temporary</b> (a project has definitive start and end)</li>
<li>Is <b>developed using progressive elaboration</b> (projects become more clear with time)</li>
<li><b>Requires resources</b>, often from various areas</li>
<li>Should <b>have a primary customer or sponsor</b> (the project sponsor usually provides the direction and funding for the project)</li>
<li><b>Involves uncertainty</b> (sometimes objectives are not clear. Cannot determine time &amp; cost. External factors also cost uncertainty)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iron-triangletriple-constraints-of-project-management">Iron triangle/triple constraints of project management</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Scope</b> - what will be done. What unique product, service or result customer expects</li>
<li><b>Time</b> - how long will it take to complete the project. Project schedule.</li>
<li><b>Cost</b> - what is the cost to complete the project. Budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful project management means meeting all 3 goals (scope, time, cost) within acceptable quality and satisfying the project stakeholders/customers.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>Project management is <b>the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.</b></p>
<h2 id="project-management-vs.-general-management">Project management Vs. General management</h2>
<p>Project management is <b>comprised of organizing, planning, motivating, and controlling procedures, resources and protocols to achieve specific goals of a specific project.</b> General management can be defined as <b>coordinating the usage of available resources and time towards the accomplishment of a specific goal or an objective of a certain organization or a business.</b></p>
<h2 id="phases-of-project-life-cycle">5 phases of project life cycle</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Initiating</b></li>
<li><b>Planning</b></li>
<li><b>Executing</b></li>
<li><b>Monitoring &amp; controlling</b> - Project manager ensures the project objectives are met.<br /> Ex: tracking, reviewing, and reporting project progress.</li>
<li><b>Closing</b> - When the deliverables are met, project is brought to an orderly end. Ex: formal sign-off from the customer, release resources, documentation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="knowledge-areas-of-project-management">Knowledge areas of Project Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scope Management</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Cost Management</li>
<li>Quality Management</li>
<li>Human Resources Management - making effective use of the people</li>
<li>Communication Management - generating, collecting, disseminating(circulate) and storing project information</li>
<li>Risk Management - identifying, analyzing and responding to risks related to projects</li>
<li>Procurement Management - acquiring goods &amp; services from outside the organization</li>
<li>Project Stakeholder Management</li>
<li>Integration Management - coordinates all aspects of a project</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope-management">Scope Management</h2>
<p>Managing all the work required to complete the project successfully. Ensure that the project includes all the work required, only the work required. This is the process of defining and controlling what should and should not include in the project.</p>
<p>Some keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes - recording/documenting the minutes of a meeting</li>
<li>Project Steering Committee - is the key body within the governance structure which is responsible for the business issues associated with the project that are essential to the ensuring the delivery of the project outputs and the attainment of project outcomes. This includes approving the budgetary strategy, defining and realizing outcomes, monitoring risks, quality and timeliness, making policy and resourcing decisions, and assessing requests for changes to the scope of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope planning - deciding how the scope will be defined, verified and controlled. Size, complexity, importantance and other factors of the project affect how much effort is spent on scope planning.
<ul>
<li>Scope management plan(document) - include descriptions about how to prepare 'project scope statement', create WBS, verify completion of project deliverables and control requests for changes to project scope. That means, planning of other main processes mentioned below. Key inputs: project charter, preliminary scope statement, project management plan</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Scope definition - reviewing the project charter and preliminary scope statement and adding more information as requirements are developed, changes are approved. Then use these as basis for project scope statement.</p></li>
<li>Creating WBS (document) (image 3,4,8) - subdividing major project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. Lowest level of WBS take no longer than 2 weeks to complete. Approaches: analogy, top down, bottom up, mind mapping(image 5,6)
<ul>
<li>work package - a task at the lowest level of the WBS</li>
<li>WBS dictionary - describes detailed information about each WBS item</li>
<li>scope baseline = project scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionary</li>
<li>How to create WBS (image 9)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Scope verification - is the process of obtaining formal acceptance of the project scope by the stakeholders (sponsor, client, customer, etc.). It requires reviewing deliverables and work results by customers to ensure that all were completed correctly and satisfactorily</p></li>
<li>Scope control - controlling changes to project scope
<ul>
<li>Variance - difference between planned &amp; actual performance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="time-management">Time Management</h2>
<p>Estimating how long it will take to complete. Make project schedule. And complete on time. Main processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity definition - identify specific activities that the project team members &amp; stakeholders must perform
<ul>
<li>Project charter - a short document that lists the scope, objectives, deliverables, and stakeholders of a project, and delineates/describes roles and responsibilities of each member of the project team.</li>
<li>Scope statement &amp; WBS helps to define what will be done</li>
<li>Milestones - significant/important event or accomplishment, no duration. It takes several activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone. Can mark milestone in gantt chart in a point or any task as a milestone. Ex: customer sign-off key documents, completion of specific products</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activity sequencing - identifying &amp; documenting the relationships between project activities
<ul>
<li>4 project dependencies - read below</li>
<li>Network diagrams

</ul></li>
<li>Activity resource estimating - estimating how many resources should be used to perform project activities</li>
<li>Activity duration estimating - estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual activities</li>
<li>Schedule development - create the project schedule by analyzing activity sequences, activity resource estimates &amp; activity duration estimate. Important tools &amp; techniques are gantt charts, critical path analysis, critical chain scheduling, PERT analysis</li>
<li>Schedule control - control &amp; manage changes to the project schedule</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cost-management">Cost Management</h2>
<p>Preparing &amp; managing the budget. Main processes:</p>
